title: Wind Waker HD
---

<p>Here you find routes for <b>The legend of zelda - Wind Waker HD</b>. This game is only available on the 
WII U for now. These routes are developed and tested by me, but of course can be totally the same as routes 
available on the Wind Waker HD community wiki.</p>
<br />
<p>These routes are for runners that want to start up running Wind Waker HD. And start from relatively easy to moderate.
The routes on this website can't or very likely can't make you a world record competer. 
They slowly set you up to get better in the game, that doesn't mean there aren't glitches in the run that need quite some practice.</p>
<br />
<p>All the glitches I come across while speedrunning this game are also featured on this website.
To document them and make other people aware they exist, same for set-ups I make.</p>
<br />
<p><span style="color:red">The glitches, bugs and exploits explained on this website are discovered by 
the Wind Waker HD community. Only the glitches I'm sure about discovered by me will state so. At the moment, I'm 
not sure if I just rediscovered some of these glitches, so I won't state them as discovered by me.
