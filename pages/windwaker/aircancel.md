<p><h1>Manipulating air meter to last longer.</h1>
<h2>Pause Swimming.</h2>
</p>
<p><b>Difficulty:</b> Easy (Need to find a good rhythm of pressing the start button)</p>
<br />
<p>Swimming from Outset to Headstone island. (Video contains flickers!)</p>

<p><b>Useful in runs?</b></p>
<p>When you splash (sploosh) in the water by hitting something while superswimming you can at times still swim to the island, cutscene trigger.
Most times it's faster to savewarp, because this pause swimming is very slow! So you need to get a feel for when it can save some time.</p>
<br />
<p><b>Controls:</b></p>
<p>- <b>Analog stick</b> in direction you want to swim.</p>
<p>- Pressing <b>start</b> in a rhythm.</p>
<p>Faster presses can make the air meter go slower but swimming cost more time. The air meter will always deplete eventually do.</p>
<br />
<p><b>How it probably works:</b></p>
<p>The calculations of link forward swimming speed probably gets calculated earlier in a frame then the air meter depletion. 
So pausing before the air depletion calculations, makes the game eat this calculation. Because it can't do it while the game is paused.</p>
