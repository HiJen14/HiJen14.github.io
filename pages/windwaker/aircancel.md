<p><h1>Manipulating air meter to last longer.</h1></p>
<p><b>Difficulty:</b> Easy (Need to find a good rhythm of pressing the start button)</p>
<p><b>Usefull in runs?</b> When you splash (sploosh) in the water by hitting something while superswimming you can at times still swim to the island, cutscene trigger.
At times it's faster to savewarp, because this pause swimming is very slow!</p>
